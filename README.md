# Dead Matter

## About
Public facing repository for Dead Matter, this is used for community submitted issues and for providing visibility on the current build / CI status. We're using GitHub as a hub for the backers that want to get involved in development because it's sleek and because we have to come on here everyday for work which means we're much more likely to see posts on here.

## Automatic-Nightly

Dead Matter has a different branch on Steam for regular testing called Automatic-Nightly, these builds are uploaded either manually by one of our developers or they are the latest build that was uploaded the night before. These builds contain all of the changes as we make them. 

We encourage all of our fans that want to be directly engaged in the development process to switch to automatic-nightly and start reporting issues that they've encountered.

## Issues

Please submit any issues that you've encountered to the Issue tracker, we'll tag it up at as approrpriate. Once an issue has been fixed, we'll tag it with in-testing and then close the issue. If you submitted the original issue and it's not addressed, re-open the issue and we'll re-examine the issue.

## Discussions

If you want to talk about the game and suggest ideas, etc. Please do so in the discussions, we're just using the default stuff that each GitHub repository ships with as a template but will flesh things out as needed to keep things organized.
